##Data Science

![Data Science specialization course ](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1/overview)

What you will learn:

* Formulate context-relevant questions and hypotheses to drive data scientific research
* Identify, obtain, and transform a data set to make it suitable for the production of statistical evidence communicated in written form
* Build models based on new data types, experimental design, and statistical inference

At completion, students will have a portfolio demonstrating their mastery of the material. The top 10 students for the capstone will get the chance to video-conference with instructors and ask them questions. In addition, top students will be profiled on the Simply Statistics Blog, a widely read data science blog.

This specialization covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results. The Specialization concludes with a Capstone project that allows you to apply the skills you've learned throughout the courses.
